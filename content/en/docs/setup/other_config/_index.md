---

You've [installed and configured Spinnaker](/docs/setup/install/), but there are still a few other things to set up:

* [Configure your image bakery](/docs/setup/bakery/)
* [Enable security](/docs/setup/security/) (auth/auth) for your Spinnaker installation
* [Set up continuous integration](/docs/setup/ci/)
* [Enable monitoring](/docs/setup/monitoring/)
* And there are a couple of [extra features](/docs/setup/features/) that you can enable
